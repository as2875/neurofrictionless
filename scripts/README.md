# Scripts

| Filename | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `analyse_bursting.py` | Detects bursts. Produces raster plots with bursts represented by coloured lines. Computes interspike intervals (ISIs) for each channel. Plots histograms of ISIs. |
| `analyse_correlations.py` | Plot distribution of STTCs in each sample, calculated using Gaussian kernel density estimation. |
| `analyse_network_spikes.py` | Plots network activity. Extracts and plots network spikes. |
| `compute_burst_statistics.py` | Computes summary statistics related to bursting. Produces a series of box plots. |
| `compute_summary_statistics.py` | Computes simple summary statistics. Plots as a series of scatter graphs. |
| `convert_h5_to_fd.py` | Simple script to convert a directory of HDF5 files to a Frictionless format using `h5fd.converter`. |
| `convert_mc_to_h5.py` | Simple script to convert a directory of MC Datatool files to HDF5 using `h5fd.converter`. |
| `correlate_pairwise.py` | Plot mean STTC against age. |
| `draw_correlation_graphs.py` | Draw graphs with each node representing a channel, each edge representing a correlation. |
