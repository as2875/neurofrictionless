# Plots

 - `burst_plots.pdf` is a raster plot with bursts marked on it. Generated by `detect_bursts.py`.
 - `development_plots.pdf` is a plot of various summary statistics (firing rate, number of spikes) against age. Generated by `compute_summary_statistics.py`.
 - `logisi_plots.pdf` contains a histogram, for every channel in every recording, of the (natural) log of the interspike interval. Generated by `compute_isi_distribution.py`
 - `logisi_plots_with_position.pdf` is like `logisi_plots.pdf`, but with each histogram located at the coordinates of its recording electrode.
 - `isi_plots` is like `logisi_plots.pdf`, but without taking the log.
 - `raster_plots.pdf` contains a raster plot, diagram of active channels, and plot of instantaneous firing rate, for every recording. Generated from the raw data by `process_mcdatatool.py`.
