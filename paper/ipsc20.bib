  abstract = "Neural networks are required to meet significant metabolic
              demands associated with performing sophisticated computational
              tasks in the brain. The necessity for efficient transmission of
              information imposes stringent constraints on the metabolic
              pathways that can be used for energy generation at the synapse,
              and thus low availability of energetic substrates can reduce the
              efficacy of synaptic function. Here we study the effects of
              energetic substrate availability on global neural network
              behavior and find that glucose alone can sustain excitatory
              neurotransmission required to generate high-frequency synchronous
              bursting that emerges in culture. In contrast, obligatory
              oxidative energetic substrates such as lactate and pyruvate are
              unable to substitute for glucose, indicating that processes
              involving glucose metabolism form the primary energy-generating
              pathways supporting coordinated network activity. Our
              experimental results are discussed in the context of the role
              that metabolism plays in supporting the performance of individual
              synapses, including the relative contributions from postsynaptic
              responses, astrocytes, and presynaptic vesicle cycling. We
              propose a simple computational model for our excitatory cultures
              that accurately captures the inability of metabolically
              compromised synapses to sustain synchronous bursting when
              extracellular glucose is depleted.",

              disorders. In the past decade, many protocols for differentiating
              hiPSCs into neurons have been developed. However, these protocols
              are often slow with high variability, low reproducibility, and
              low efficiency. In addition, the neurons obtained with these
              protocols are often immature and lack adequate functional
              activity both at the single-cell and network levels unless the
              neurons are cultured for several months. Partially due to these
              limitations, the functional properties of hiPSC-derived neuronal
              networks are still not well characterized. Here, we adapt a
              recently published protocol that describes production of human
              neurons from hiPSCs by forced expression of the transcription
              factor neurogenin-212. This protocol is rapid (yielding mature
              neurons within 3 weeks) and efficient, with nearly 100\%
              conversion efficiency of transduced cells (>95\% of DAPI-positive
              cells are MAP2 positive). Furthermore, the protocol yields a
              homogeneous population of excitatory neurons that would allow the
              investigation of cell-type specific contributions to neurological
              disorders. We modified the original protocol by generating stably
              transduced hiPSC cells, giving us explicit control over the total
              number of neurons. These cells are then used to generate
              hiPSC-derived neuronal networks on micro-electrode arrays. In
              this way, the spontaneous electrophysiological activity of
              hiPSC-derived neuronal networks can be measured and
              characterized, while retaining interexperimental consistency in
              terms of cell density. The presented protocol is broadly

  abstract = "BACKGROUND: Neural circuits can spontaneously generate complex
              spatiotemporal firing patterns during development. This
              spontaneous activity is thought to help guide development of the
              nervous system. In this study, we had two aims. First, to
              characterise the changes in spontaneous activity in cultures of
              developing networks of either hippocampal or cortical neurons
              dissociated from mouse. Second, to assess whether there are any
              functional differences in the patterns of activity in hippocampal
              and cortical networks. RESULTS: We used multielectrode arrays to
              record the development of spontaneous activity in cultured
              networks of either hippocampal or cortical neurons every 2 or 3
              days for the first month after plating. Within a few days of
              culturing, networks exhibited spontaneous activity. This activity
              strengthened and then stabilised typically around 21 days in
              vitro. We quantified the activity patterns in hippocampal and
              cortical networks using 11 features. Three out of 11 features
              showed striking differences in activity between hippocampal and
              cortical networks: (1) interburst intervals are less variable in
              spike trains from hippocampal cultures; (2) hippocampal networks
              have higher correlations and (3) hippocampal networks generate
              more robust theta-bursting patterns. Machine-learning techniques
              confirmed that these differences in patterning are sufficient to
              classify recordings reliably at any given age as either
              hippocampal or cortical networks. CONCLUSIONS: Although cultured
              networks of hippocampal and cortical networks both generate
              spontaneous activity that changes over time, at any given time we
              can reliably detect differences in the activity patterns. We
              anticipate that this quantitative framework could have
              applications in many areas, including neurotoxicity testing and
              for characterising the phenotype of different mutant mice. All

               correlation index is widely used and is the standard in studies
               of spontaneous retinal activity. We show that this measure has
               two undesirable properties: it is unbounded above and confounded
               by firing rate. We list properties needed for a measure to
               fairly quantify and compare correlations and we propose a novel
               measure of correlation---the spike time tiling coefficient. This
               coefficient, the correlation index, and 33 other measures of
               correlation of spike times are blindly tested for the required
               properties on synthetic and experimental data. Based on this, we
               propose a measure (the spike time tiling coefficient) to replace
               the correlation index. To demonstrate the benefits of this
               measure, we reanalyze data from seven key studies, which
               previously used the correlation index to investigate the nature
               of spontaneous activity. We reanalyze data from $\beta$2(KO) and
               $\beta$2(TG) mutants, mutants lacking connexin isoforms, and
               also the age-dependent changes in wild-type and $\beta$2(KO)
               correlations. Reanalysis of the data using the proposed measure
               can significantly change the conclusions. It leads to better
               quantification of correlations and therefore better inference
               from the data. We hope that the proposed measure will have wide

               electrical activity within and between neuronal assemblies. In
               vivo measurements show that the size of individual assemblies
               depends on their function and varies considerably, but the
               timescale of assembly activation is in the range of 0.1-0.2 s
               and is primarily independent of assembly size. Here we use an in
               vitro experimental model of cortical assemblies to characterize
               the process underlying the timescale of synchronization, its
               relationship to the effective topology of connectivity within an
               assembly, and its impact on propagation of activity within and
               between assemblies. We show that the basic mode of assembly
               activation, ``network spike,'' is a threshold-governed,
               synchronized population event of 0.1-0.2 s duration and follows
               the logistics of neuronal recruitment in an effectively
               scale-free connected network. Accordingly, the sequence of
               neuronal activation within a network spike is nonrandom and
               hierarchical; a small subset of neurons is consistently
               recruited tens of milliseconds before others. Theory predicts
               that scale-free topology allows for synchronization time that
               does not increase markedly with network size; our experiments
               with networks of different densities support this prediction.
               The activity of early-to-fire neurons reliably forecasts an
               upcoming network spike and provides means for expedited
               propagation between assemblies. We demonstrate this capacity by
               observing the dynamics of two artificially coupled assemblies in

               electrical stimulation of the other.",

              Despite this, no one technique for identifying bursts in spike
              trains has been widely adopted. Instead, many methods have been
              developed for the analysis of bursting activity, often on an ad
              hoc basis. Here we provide an unbiased assessment of the
              effectiveness of eight of these methods at detecting bursts in a
              range of spike trains. We suggest a list of features that an
              ideal burst detection technique should possess and use synthetic
              data to assess each method in regard to these properties. We
              further employ each of the methods to reanalyze microelectrode
              array (MEA) recordings from mouse retinal ganglion cells and
              examine their coherence with bursts detected by a human observer.
              We show that several common burst detection techniques perform
              poorly at analyzing spike trains with a variety of properties. We
              identify four promising burst detection techniques, which are
              then applied to MEA recordings of networks of human induced
              pluripotent stem cell-derived neurons and used to describe the
              ontogeny of bursting activity in these networks over several
